## Description of Code
The code lets the user go to combat with the computer by utilizing themes from the game "Dungeons and Dragons." It should be noted that none of the inputs in this game are case sensitive to capitalization, so they may be written in upper or lower case. The user is greeted by the game and can choose which character they would like to play, a Warlock or Ranger, who would go against a Monk. The statistics for each character which include the Player Type, Health, Attack, and Dodge are are printed out for the user to see which character they would like to utilize for the game. Moreover, the user can choose from three different difficulty levels. When playing the game, the user can choose to Attack or Dodge the Monk's play, which would affect both the health of the Monk and the user's character. If both characters attack, both their attacks will affect the other's health. If one chooses to attack and the other dodges, the character who dodged will still get a percentage of the attacker's attack deducted from their health. If both of the characters dodge, neither of their healths will be affected. After each round, information about whether or not the opponent dodged, how much damage each character dealt and doged, and their current health status will be printed on the screen. The game keeps going, asking the user to attack or dodge as long as both character's still have a health that is above 0. Once, either of the health's touch or go below 0, the game will end and the winner will be printed on the screen. It is possible for the game to end in a draw.
