## Description of Code
The code lets the user go to combat with the computer by utilizing themes from the game "Dungeons and Dragons." It should be noted that none of the inputs in this game are case sensitive to capitalization, so they may be written in upper or lower case. The user is greeted by the game and can choose which character they would like to play from a table of charactes and may also choose who their opponent would be. A "random" option is available for users to be assigned a random opponent.The statistics for each character which include the Player Tsype, Health, Attack, Attack Dice, and Dodge dice are are printed out for the user to see which character they would like to utilize for the game. When playing the game, the user can choose to Attack or Dodge their opponent's play, which would affect both the health of the opponent and the user's character. If both characters attack, both their attacks will affect the other's health. If one chooses to attack and the other dodges, the character who dodged will still get a percentage of the attacker's attack deducted from their health through an attack modifier, but if they get lucky, their dice roll will save them and may not get any damage at all! If both of the characters dodge, neither of their healths will be affected. After each round, information about whether or not the opponent dodged, how much damage each character dealt and doged, and their current health status will be printed on the screen. The game keeps going, asking the user to attack or dodge as long as both character's still have a health that is above 0. Once, either of the health's touch 0, the game will end and the winner will be printed on the screen.
