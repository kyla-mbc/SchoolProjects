## Description of Code
The code lets the user go to combat with the computer by utilizing themes from the game "Dungeons and Dragons." It should be noted that none of the inputs in this game are case sensitive to capitalization, so they may be written in upper or lower case. Each round is separated by a number of that round and the actions and results of each round are printed in a Transcript that can be named by the user. The user is greeted by the game and can choose which character they would like to play from a table of charactes and may also choose who their opponent would be. A "random" option is available for users to be assigned a random opponent.The statistics for each character which include the Player Type, Health, Attack, Attack Dice, and Dodge dice are are printed out for the user to see which character they would like to utilize for the game. When playing the game, the user can choose to Attack or Dodge their opponent's play, which would affect both the health of the opponent and the user's character. If both characters attack, both their attacks will affect the other's health. If one chooses to attack and the other dodges, the character who dodged will still get a percentage of the attacker's attack deducted from their health through an attack modifier, but if they get lucky, their dice roll will save them and may not get any damage at all! If both of the characters dodge, neither of their healths will be affected. After each round, information about whether or not the opponent dodged, how much damage each character dealt and doged, and their current health status will be printed on the screen. The game keeps going, asking the user to attack or dodge as long as both character's still have a health that is above 0. Once either of the health's touch 0, the game will end and the winner will be printed on the screen, a draw can also be a result of the game when both players' health reaches 0 on the same round. The user will be asked if they would like their transcript printed out at the end of the game. 

Extra Credit: 
The user is able to choose "Customize" as a third option aside from "Attack" and "Dodge". They can choose to increase their health, dodge, or attack. The NPC is also able to choose a customized option.
