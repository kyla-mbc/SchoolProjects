ERRORS 
- Initial errors when compiling due to not having std:: placed between some commands. This was an easy fix and the code worked well. 

SOURCES
- I used coding lecture codes from my C++ course spepcifically with properly utilizing the content of the header files in the cpp files. 
- I referred to our lecture and code on arrays.
- I had assistance from Carolina Velez who has taken the course before on how to properly organize the code. 
- I collaborated with Donnie Militante and Manuel Pangelinan,also helped me debug, on analyzing the instructions and brainstorming our project.

HOW TO RUN THE code
-  g++ *.cpp -o a2.exe
- ./a2.exe GameInput.txt GameOutput.txt

GameInput.txt : Input used for the specs of the game
GameOutput.txt : Empty file for gameplay use. 
a2.exe : executable file
