ERRORS 
- When running my code, I noticed the output numbers rounding up. I realized it might be due to my choice of using floats for my code. 

SOURCES
- I used coding lecture codes from my C++ course spepcifically with properly utilizing the content of the header files in the cpp files. 
- I referred to our lecture and code on stack and queue commands.
- Zybooks lesson on stacks and queues. 
- I collaborated with Manuel Pangelinan and Gianna Arenas on this project. 
- I asked ChatGPT "How to stop my output from rounding in c++ when given certain inputs?" 


HOW TO RUN THE code
1. g++ *.cpp -o code.exe
2. ./code.exe input.txt
