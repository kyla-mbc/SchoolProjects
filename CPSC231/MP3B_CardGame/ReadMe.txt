Course number and section: CPSC-231-05
Assignment: MP3B: ERS

ERRORS
- I had various errors in my code with compilation due to how I initially wrote out my code. I decided to split up face cards and regular play cards to fix my errors.
- Initial errors were found when compiling the code due to issues in the public int play() section in the public class Game. 
This was resolved by adding a while loop so that the code would check that there is still more than 1 player in the game. 

SOURCES
- I had assistance from Manuel Pangelinan and Ferdinand Paloma with creating the methods for public int play() as well as the formatting of the ouput.
- Zybooks assignments pertaining to classes and list methods for LinkedLists.
- Previous Lectures especially the Classes and Collections sections.
